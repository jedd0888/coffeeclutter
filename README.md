# The CoffeeClutter project
This bot was made in 2020, for my friend, but is now public on the internet as I do not need these bot files anymore.

## Installation

1. Install [node.js](nodejs.org/), version 16.9+ (LTS RECOMMENDED)
2. Download the bot files, either with `git clone https://github.com/jedd0888/coffeeclutter` or by downloading the repo as a ZIP by clicking the `Code` button dropdown
3. Configure your bot token and prefix in botsettings.json
4. Run `npm install` in your terminal, where your bot files are to install the required dependencies
5. `node index.js` to start the bot, or use a PROCESS MANAGER (pm2) `pm2 start index.js` https://github.com/Unitech/pm2

## Contributing
You can contribute to this bot and add features / improve bot efficiency.
